More about this game and it&#39;s rules you can read on <a class="underline" href="https://minesweepergame.com/website/authoritative-minesweeper/wiki/Windows_Minesweeper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MinesweeperWiki</a>. While the original game is 2D (everything happens on a plane), my idea was to make it only 1D (everything happens on a single line). You can find 3D and even 4D versions on the internet, but to my surprise no one was dumb enough to remake it in a single dimension untill me.</p><p class="mt-3 text-center text-gray-700 italic">Texture atlas is also 1D:</p><img class="min-w-[300px] w-[75vw] mx-auto pt-1" style="image-rendering:pixelated;" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82185066/197850339-6fef63d5-78a2-4dbb-a599-cef29248a9a2.png"><p class="mt-3">One of the biggest challenges of 1D games is making players understand what is happening even. By using depth map and carefully chosen textures it is possible to make a 3D-like scene - <a class="underline" href="https://youtu.be/3xx7sgNVE-A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mashpoe</a> did it for example. I, on the other hand, couldn&#39;t rely on shaders and 3D anaglyph effect, my only tool was textures. The fact that textures of the original Minesweeper are so recognizable helps a lot too, plus to that I think I did a good job at keeping key parts of original sprites, for example:</p><ul class="list-disc ml-10"><li>empty cell didn&#39;t change at all</li><li>1 and 2 instead of using arabic numerals, use roman - I and II</li><li>default cell clearly looks 3D&#39;ish</li><li>flag uses gradient, emulating original triangular look</li><li>mines are spiky</li><li>crossed mine uses same 2 red lines, just positioned differently</li></ul>',7),o=[l],m=e({__name:"about",setup(r){return a({title:"About"}),(p,d)=>(n(),t("div",i,o))}});export{m as default};
